# Component-Library
## Description

- currently the only component in the library is TABS.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run project locally:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make any code changes.

### `npm run cy:open`

This will run the Cypress testing suite for the exercise!

##Validation

Once you have completed the challenge and all tests are passing you should should have a component that looks like the image below!
**Note: Dont forget to run `Axe-Devtools` on the component to ensure it's accessible to others.
